class AnomalibMLFlowLogger(ImageLoggerBase, MLFlowLogger):
    """Logger for MLFlow.

    Adds interface for ``add_image`` in the logger rather than calling the
    experiment object.

    .. note::
        Same as the MLFlowLogger provided by PyTorch Lightning and the doc string is reproduced below.

    Track your parameters, metrics, source code and more using
    `MLFlow <https://mlflow.org/#core-concepts>`_.

    Install it with pip:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install mlflow

    Args:
        experiment_name: The name of the experiment.
        run_name: Name of the new run.
            The `run_name` is internally stored as a ``mlflow.runName`` tag.
            If the ``mlflow.runName`` tag has already been set in `tags`, the value is overridden by the `run_name`.
        tracking_uri: Address of local or remote tracking server.
            If not provided, defaults to `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable if set, otherwise it falls
            back to `file:<save_dir>`.
        save_dir: A path to a local directory where the MLflow runs get saved.
            Defaults to `./mlruns` if `tracking_uri` is not provided.
            Has no effect if `tracking_uri` is provided.
        log_model: Log checkpoints created by `ModelCheckpoint` as MLFlow artifacts.

            - if ``log_model == 'all'``, checkpoints are logged during training.
            - if ``log_model == True``, checkpoints are logged at the end of training, \
                except when `save_top_k == -1` which also logs every checkpoint during training.
            - if ``log_model == False`` (default), no checkpoint is logged.

        prefix: A string to put at the beginning of metric keys. Defaults to ``''``.
        kwargs: Additional arguments like `tags`, `artifact_location` etc. used by
            `MLFlowExperiment` can be passed as keyword arguments in this logger.

    Example:
        >>> from anomalib.loggers import AnomalibMLFlowLogger
        >>> from anomalib.engine import Engine
        ...
        >>> mlflow_logger = AnomalibMLFlowLogger()
        >>> engine = Engine(logger=mlflow_logger)
